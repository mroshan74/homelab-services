Notes:
- The bind IP should be that of control/command server
- The specfied port should allowed in firewall for the data transfer
- Works well when the ssh keys are passed for the vm access creation

Commands:
packer init .
packer validate -var-file='../credentials.pkr.hcl' .
packer build -var-file='../credentials.pkr.hcl' .
